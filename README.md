# Transitions
Transitions is an annual transformative event, geared towards bringing together impact leaders, and growth-hungry individuals into a space where high-level conversations are made and key strategies for personal transformation is disbursed.

A trip down memory lane:
During the maiden event in November 2023, we were privy to host 12 High Profile speakers, alongside an electric crowd of 1,000 participants in the city of Calabar. It was an immersive experience which featured; sparky conversations, plenary sessions, Q&A, and networking all for the purpose of distilling strategies, trends, and technologies to make the participants stand out in 2024. The goal of last year's event was to encourage capacity building and shape the African entrepreneurial landscape for more.
